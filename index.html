          <h2>You are tracked, and analyzed on the web</h2>
          <p>Every time you visit a website with ads, cookies are stored on your computer. Cookies are not evil, they are mandatory for maintaining user sessions open (as of today). But what advertising companies can do with them could be somehow dangerous.</p>
          <p>With one cookie, anouncers can know what website you've been on, so they can create a profile corresponding to your likes and dislikes. With this information, they can show you advertisements that you might find interesting. All this data is kept jealously by ads companies and sold to their customers: you are the product.</p>
          <h2>What if these companies sell your data to governments?</h2>
          <p>This sounds far-fetched, and you probably feel that this is a strange question. Shouldn't you trust your government? IMHO, I think this could happen. There already exist several laws that track users for the sake of "anti-terrorism" and "anti-piracy". These laws allow governments to spy on you, and then, your Internet privacy becomes really important. (This is why, even if I have anything to hide and among other reasons, I chose to <a href="http://blog.bluepyth.fr/en/2012/09/26/leaving-google/">leave Google services</a>).</p>
          <p>This can also be dangerous for Human Rights, as in every country, dicidents can be persecuted for just not agreeing on some topics...</p>

          <h2>There are no advertisements</h2>
          <p>This will prevent you from being tracked through my websites. Also, I don't plan to earn money with these small websites :)</p>
          <h2>I use my own analytics software</h2>
          <p>For as long as I hosted websites (be it on a shared server, or on my dedicated server), I used analytics to see how many visitors came to my websites, where they were from and so on.</p>
          <p>Google Analytics is a great software, but all the data belongs to them, so I searched for a self-hosted solution, and I found <a href="http://piwik.org">Piwik</a>. So your data is stored on my server, and I could delete it if you wanted me to.</p>
